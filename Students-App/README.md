# Students-App
App that manages student objects. Object oriented programming implemented.

Manage  a  list  of students.  Each  student  has  an id(integer, unique),  a name(string)  and a group(positive integer). 

The program provides a menu-driven console user interface.

There are 10 programmatically generated entries in the application at start-up (using 'names' module).

It provides the user the following features:

1.Add a new student to the list. Student data is read from the console.

2.Show the list of students on the console.

3.Filter the list so that students in a given group (read from the console) are deleted from the list.

4.Undo the last operation that modified program data. This step can be repeated.
